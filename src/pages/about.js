        <p className="short-intro mt-5 ps-5 pe-5" align="start">
          Iâ€™m a Computer Science (Network Computing) Graduate from Brunel University London, having achieved 2.1 with Honours.
          I enjoy taking on challenges as it enables me to think differently and bring out the best of me. I simply love
          learning and building new experiences.<br />

          <h5 className='header5'>Long-term Goal</h5>
          I am aiming to become a Full Stack Developer, to be able to create cross-platform web and mobile applications. Having
          said that, I am open to learning Software Developer/Engineering (Front-end and/or Back-end), DevOps and Testing/QA. To learn all
          of these technologies is a long-term goal.<br /><br />
          <h5 className='header5'>For now</h5>
          For now, I would love to dive into anyone of these roles and have a core focus!<br /><br />
          <h5 className='header5'>Passion</h5>
          I have begun to read documentation on JavaScript, React and soon more about jQuery, I am learning the fundamentals of these
          and in the process of building a project based on React and React-Native framework. The first project will be a mobile and TV application.
          Also, to be able to implement DevOps principles such as setting up CI/CD pipeline and working with Cloud service e.g. AWS.<br /><br /><br />

              During my university studies, I have had extensive exposure to Java programming language including completing weekly programming challenges set on a deadline basis, these were based on algorithms and data structures.
              <br /><br />
              Each year I have been involved in a core project where the first two years of my studies has involved group projects; building skills on teamwork and collaboration via Git version control and GitHub.
              <br /><br />
              The collage represents all the core skillsets I have built over the course of three years, including the software development lifecycle and agile methodologies.
